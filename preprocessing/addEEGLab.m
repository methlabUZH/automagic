function parts = addEEGLab()
% addEEGLab  Add the eeglab package to the path
%   eeglab package is assumed to be in folder matlab_scripts located in the
%   parent directory. The need for this function is to remove the path to
%   few folders of eeglab which make conflicts with other MATLAB functions.
%   This functions is strongly recommended over the use of
%   `addpath(genpath('path/to/eeglab'))`.
%
%   parts = addEEGLab()
%
%   parts: all the paths in EEGLAB folder. This is returned for the cases
%   where it is needed.
