function log = getLogTextStruct()
% getLogTextStruct  Return a structure containing lines to be printed to
% create the log file at the end of the preprocessing. Each line
% corresponds to a specific step of preprocessing and is printed if that
% specific preprocessing step is used.
%
%   Simply change the text here and the log file will be changed
%   accordingly.
%
%   The text is hardcoded and need to be changed accordingly if anything in
%   the preprocessing steps is changed.
